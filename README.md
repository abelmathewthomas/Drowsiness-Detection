# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an AI-based Driver Drowsiness Detection System. The project aims to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver drowsiness and alerting them in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using computer vision techniques.
- Monitoring facial landmarks for signs of drowsiness.
- Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for drowsiness detection.
- Audio and visual alerts to notify the driver in case of drowsiness.
